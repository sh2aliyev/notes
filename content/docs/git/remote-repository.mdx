title: Remote Repository
---

A remote repository is a copy of your project that lives on a server accessible over a network. It acts as a shared location where team members can push their work and pull updates from others.

## Getting From

Bringing a remote repository to your local machine.

- `git clone <remote_url>`: Create a local copy of a remote repository.
  > - `.` - Clone directly into the current directory instead of creating a new folder.

## Setting Up

Connecting your local repository to a remote.

<Callout>
  If you cloned a repository, the remote setup is already done. The cloning operation automatically sets the default
  remote as `origin`.
</Callout>

- `git remote`: List all available remotes.
  > - `-v` - Show remotes with their URLs.
  > - `add <remote_name> <remote_url>` - Add a new remote connection.
  > - `rename <remote_name> <new_remote_name>` - Rename a remote.
  > - `remove <remote_name>` - Remove a remote.

## Applying To

Sending your local work to the remote repository.

- `git push`: Upload commits from your current branch to the matching branch on the remote repository.

  > If it is the first time you are pushing the branch you need to set upstream.
  >
  > - `-u <remote_name> <branch_name>` - Push and set the upstream for the current branch.
  >   > What is an upstream?
  >   >
  >   > > An upstream is the remote branch that your local branch tracks. When it is set, Git knows where to push and pull by default.

  > Situations when pushing:
  >
  > 1. Remote has no changes.
  >    > If no one has updated the remote branch since your last fetch or pull, your push will succeed without issues.
  > 2. Remote has changes.
  >
  >    > If the remote branch has updates, Git will reject your push indicating the branch has diverged.
  >    >
  >    > In this case you need to update your local branch using `git pull` or you can force push if you intend to overwrite.

  > - `-f` - Forcefully push overwriting any changes on the remote branch.
  > - `--force-with-lease` - Forcefully push in a safer way.
  >   > Checks the remote branch to be exactly the same as when you last saw it.
  >   >
  >   > - If someone else pushed meanwhile, the operation is rejected.
  >   > - If the changes belong to you, Git allows the overwrite.
  >   >
  >   > This is useful when you pushed something incorrect and want to immediately push a corrected version completely overwriting/removing the incorrect one.

- `git fetch`: Download updates from the remote.

  > This updates your remote tracking branches, adds new ones if there are, and downloads any other data your local repository is missing. Your working directory stays unchanged while your local view of the remote becomes up to date.

  > - `--prune` - Remove any local references to remote branches that no longer exist on the remote repository.

<Callout title="What is Remote Tracking Branch?">

A remote tracking branch is a local reference that represents the state of a branch on the remote.

It is not the remote repository itself. It only represents what the remote looked like the last time you fetched or pulled.

- Commands like `git status` and `git log` do not contact the remote. They compare your local branch with its remote tracking branch.
- A remote tracking branch can fall behind the actual remote repository. Keeping it updated makes your comparisons accurate.
- These branches are stored locally under names such as `origin/main` and they are read only which means you can compare them with your work,
  merge changes from them, or create new branches based on them but you cannot modify them directly.

</Callout>

- `git pull`: Download and integrate updates from the remote.

  > This command combines `git fetch` and `git merge`.
  >
  > - `--rebase` - Apply your local changes on top of the latest remote changes instead of merging (the same logic as [Rebasing / Integrating Changes](./rebasing.mdx#integrating-changes)).
