title: Worktrees
---

Git worktrees let you have multiple working directories attached to a single repository.

- `git worktree`
  > - `list` - Show all active worktrees.
  > - `add <path> <branch_name>` - Create a worktree for an existing branch.
  > - `add <path> <commit_hash>` - Create a worktree at a specific commit in a `detached HEAD` state.
  > - `remove <path>` - Remove the worktree folder and its reference.

How?

> - A worktree is simply another folder connected to the same repository.
> - It can point to any branch or commit.
> - Each worktree is isolated in its working files, but all of them share the same Git history.
> - Switching to a worktree is simply moving into that folder with `cd`.

Why?

> - You can work on different branches or commits in parallel.
> - You avoid stashing or making temporary commits just to move around.
> - Each task stays in its own separate folder.

## Worktree Strategies

<Callout type="warn" title="Do not place worktrees inside other working directories.">

If you create a worktree folder inside another working directory, Git treats the folder as new content.

While Git can detect that it is a worktree and reduce it to a single entry, it still shows up as untracked content, which you usually don't want in your real project history.

</Callout>

With this warning in mind, there are two approaches to structuring projects when working with worktrees:

1.  Keep your worktrees outside the main working directory.
    > E.g., right next to your main project folder.
    > `git worktree add ../feat feature`
    >
    > ```sh
    > ├─ project/  # <- main working directory
    > ├─ feat/     # <- worktree for a feature branch
    > ```
2.  Use a bare clone.

    > - `git clone --bare <remote_url>`: Create a local bare copy of a remote repository.

    > A bare clone is a repository without a working directory. It contains only the `.git` data.
    >
    > To start working, you need to create a worktree.
