title: Declaring Variables
---

<Callout type="warn">You cannot re-declare a variable that has already been declared in the same scope.</Callout>

## Using the `var` keyword

```go
var varName type = value
```

> Variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their zero value.

- You must specify either `type` or `value` (or both):

  ```go
  var name string = "John"  // explicit type and value
  var surname = "Doe"       // type is inferred as string
  var age int16             // explicit type, initialized to the zero value (0)
  ```

- Declaring multiple variables of the same or different types on a single line:

  ```go
  var name, age = "John", 30  // mixed types, types inferred
  var a, b, c int = 1, 2, 3   // all must be of the declared type
  var x, y int                // both initialized to the zero value (0)
  ```

- Using grouped declaration syntax to declare variables together:

  ```go
  var (
  	name    string = "John"
  	surname        = "Doe"  // type is inferred as string
  	age     int             // zero value (0)
  )
  ```

## Using the `:=` syntax

```go
varName := value
```

> Can only be used inside functions, not at the package level.

- Declaring multiple variables on a single line:

  ```go
  name, age := "John", 30
  ```

## Using the `const` keyword

Constants are fixed values that cannot be changed after they are declared. They are read-only.

```go
const varName type = value
```

- Constants can be declared without explicit types, but they must have values:

  ```go
  const daysInWeek int = 7  // explicit type and value
  const hoursInDay = 24     // type is inferred as int
  ```

- Declaring multiple constants in a single block:

  ```go
  const (
  	daysInWeek = 7
  	hoursInDay = 24
  )
  ```

> Computations on constants are mostly done at compile time, not at runtime.
