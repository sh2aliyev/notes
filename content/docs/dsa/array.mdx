## Overview

Array is a data structure that lets you store multiple values in one variable. Each value in the array is called an element,
and elements are accessed using their index, which starts at `0` for the first element.

| Operations               | Complexity | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Access/Edit i-th element | O(1)       | Arrays give direct access to elements through their index.                                                           |
| Insert/Remove            | O(n)       | Adding or removing an element at a specific index requires shifting all later elements to make room or fill the gap. |
| Insert/Remove at end     | O(1)       | Adding or removing an element at the end only needs updating the last index.                                         |

### Background

Arrays are usually stored as contiguous memory blocks. This means all elements sit next to each other in memory with no gaps in between.

> When an array is created, the system allocates a block of memory large enough to hold all elements.
> The memory address of each element is based on the starting address of the array.
> The first element sits at the starting address, and each following element is placed at the next available address.
>
> ```c++
> int arr[5] = {3, 7, 1, 2, 3};
> ```
>
> If each integer takes 4 bytes, the memory addresses look like this:
>
> ```sh
> Address of arr[0] = starting address
> Address of arr[1] = starting address + 4
> Address of arr[2] = starting address + 8
> Address of arr[3] = starting address + 12
> Address of arr[4] = starting address + 16
> ```
>
> Because the memory is contiguous, accessing elements is efficient. The address of any element can be calculated from the starting address and the size of each element.
> This makes direct access possible without looping or searching.

Different languages are designed with different goals related to performance, control, and flexibility, arrays can differ with their declaration and capabilities.

- Static Arrays:
  > - They have a fixed size declared ahead of time.
  > - They use a set amount of memory for the entire program.
  > - Trying to add more elements than the set size can lead to overflow or memory issues.
- Dynamic Arrays:

  > - They do not need a fixed size in advance.
  > - They can grow or shrink during runtime.
  > - Some languages give them a default starting capacity. When this capacity is exceeded, the array is resized.
  > - Resizing usually means creating a new larger block of memory, often 2x or 1.5x bigger, copying all existing elements into it, and freeing the old block.
  >   > The worst case for resizing has a time complexity of `O(n)` because all elements must be copied one by one.
