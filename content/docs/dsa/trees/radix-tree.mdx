title: Radix Tree (Compressed Trie)
---

## Overview

A Radix Tree is an optimized version of a [Trie (Prefix Tree)](./trie.mdx) that stores strings by combining chains of single-child nodes. Basically, each node can represent a sequence of characters instead of just one.

> Use cases: Autocomplete, IP routing tables, file system paths, dictionary storage, search indexing.

> Trie example for the following words: `bar`, `bark`, `bear`, `bell`, `bet`, `car`, `start`, `state`, `stop`, `key`.
