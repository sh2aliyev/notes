## Overview

A method for finding the sum of an arithmetic series in `O(1)` time.

Formula:

```js
S = (n / 2) * (i + j);
```

> - `i`: First term.
> - `j`: Last term.
> - `n`: Number of terms.
>   > ```js
>   > n = (j - i) / d + 1;
>   > ```
>   >
>   > - `d`: Common difference (the step between terms).
>   >   > e.g., in `2, 4, 6, 8` the step is `2`, so `d = 2`.

## Examples

1. Sum of the numbers from `0` to `10`:

   ```js
   i = 0
   j = 10
   d = 1
   n = (10 - 0) / 1 + 1 = 11

   S = (11 / 2) * (0 + 10) = 5.5 * 10 = 55
   ```

2. Sum of the numbers from `-5` to `2`:

   ```js
   i = -5
   j = 2
   d = 1
   n = (2 - (-5)) / 1 + 1 = 8

   S = (8 / 2) * ((-5) + 2) = 4 * (-3) = -12
   ```

3. Sum of the given numbers `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]`:

   ```js
   i = 2
   j = 14
   d = 2
   n = (14 - 2) / 2 + 1 = 7

   S = (7 / 2) * (2 + 14) = 3.5 * 16 = 56
   ```
