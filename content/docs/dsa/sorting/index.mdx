Sorting algorithms are a set of techniques used to arrange elements, with each algorithm having its own strengths and weaknesses, making it suitable for different scenarios and types of data.

| [Quick Sort](./quick-sort.mdx)                            | No      | `O(n log(n))` (worst: `O(n^2)`) | `O(log(n))` |
| [Counting Sort](./counting-sort.mdx)                      | Yes     | `O(n + k)`                      | `O(k)`      |
| [Radix Sort ↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort) | Yes     | `O(nk)`                         | `O(n + k)`  |
| [Heap Sort ↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort)    | No      | `O(n log(n))`                   | `O(1)`      |

> - Stable: Equal elements keep their original order.
> - Unstable: Equal elements might not keep their original order.
