title: Sorting
---

Sorting algorithms are a set of techniques used to arrange elements, with each algorithm having its own strengths and weaknesses, making it suitable for different scenarios and types of data.

| Name           | Stable? | Time                            | Space       |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Bubble Sort    | Yes     | `O(n^2)`                        | `O(1)`      |
| Selection Sort | No      | `O(n^2)`                        | `O(1)`      |
| Insertion Sort | Yes     | `O(n^2)`                        | `O(1)`      |
| Merge Sort     | Yes     | `O(n log(n))`                   | `O(n)`      |
| Quick Sort     | No      | `O(n log(n))` (worst: `O(n^2)`) | `O(log(n))` |
| Counting Sort  | Yes     | `O(n + k)`                      | `O(k)`      |
| Radix Sort     | Yes     | `O(nk)`                         | `O(n + k)`  |
| Heap Sort      | No      | `O(n log(n))`                   | `O(1)`      |

> - Stable: Equal elements keep their original order.
> - Unstable: Equal elements might not keep their original order.
